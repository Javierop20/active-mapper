Active-mapper is a tool for creating a CMDB of the actives detected in a PCAP, extract information of them and save them in a JSON Format and show them in a web browser report.
Also export the PCAP to GEXF for graphical representation of the communication between nodes.

It uses [Bro/Zeek](https://github.com/bro/bro) for the disection, [JA3](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3) for the detection of User-Agents and [p0f](https://github.com/p0f/p0f) for the OS Detection.

Active-mapper is meant to be used in Ubuntu environments or in WSL of Windows. Developed by Javier Ortega for the final thesis in Telecommunications Engineering of the Universidad de Zaragoza.

### Features
- Support of multitude of protocols
- Quick creation of reports
- JSON Output
- GEXF Representation of the nodes and edges

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/Javierop20/active-mapper.git
```

2. Install the tool (sudo privileges needed)

```buildoutcfg
cd active-mapper/TFG/
python3 install.py
```

3. Exectute the tool

```buildoutcfg
python3 app.py
```

## Usage

```buildoutcfg
$ python3 app.py

Introduce the base directory where the pcap is located:
<----Introduce here the directory with only the .pcap in it--->

```

## TODO
- Website for the GEXF
- Improve the performance of the tool in bigger PCAPs
- Add real-time analysis
